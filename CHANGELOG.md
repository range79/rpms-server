> This release finalizes the major architectural changes, introduces dual database support, and implements new social features in a fully stable and secure manner. All security configurations have been integrated and tested, ensuring production readiness.

### 🚀 Major Changes

* PostgreSQL handles all user and security data via JPA, while MongoDB manages flexible package data.
* JPA integration ensures efficient and stable database operations.

### 🧩 Architecture & Structural Improvements

* Project is modularized with clear separation of concerns.

* Enums and common utilities are centralized in dedicated packages.
* New services like AdminPackageService are fully operational.

### 🆕 New Features

* User profile management including avatars, bios, and social links.
* Friend request system with proper status handling and custom exceptions.
* Package visibility options: PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and ONLY\_FRIENDS.
* User metadata DTO for secure and optimized frontend communication.
* User settings functionality allowing profile and preference updates.

### 🔒 Security

* All API endpoints are secured with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* JWT-based authentication is fully integrated and tested.
* Package-level access control is implemented for different visibility levels.
* Modular `SecurityFilterChain` ensures tailored security policies per module.

### 🧹 Code Cleanup & Performance

* Codebase optimized for maintainability and clarity.
* Swagger annotations reduced for cleaner API documentation.
* Unused dependencies removed for faster builds and runtime.

### 🌐 Frontend Integration (Planned)

* Initial backend API support is prepared for frontend consumption.
* A modern frontend client will be developed and integrated in future releases to enhance user experience and interface.

### ✅ Known Issues

* No critical issues currently reported.
* Minor improvements will be addressed in upcoming patch releases based on user feedback.
