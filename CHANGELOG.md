## Version 2.0.0 ‚Äì Stable Release

üì¶ Range Package Manager 2.0.0

> This release finalizes the major architectural changes, introduces dual database support, and implements new social features in a fully stable and secure manner. All security configurations have been integrated and tested, ensuring production readiness.

### üöÄ Major Changes

* PostgreSQL and MongoDB now work seamlessly side-by-side.
* PostgreSQL handles all user and security data via JPA, while MongoDB manages flexible package data.
* JPA integration ensures efficient and stable database operations.

### üß© Architecture & Structural Improvements

* Project is modularized with clear separation of concerns.
* Controllers are refactored and responsibilities are split (e.g., AdminPackageController, UserPackageController).
* Enums and common utilities are centralized in dedicated packages.
* New services like AdminPackageService are fully operational.

### üÜï New Features

* User profile management including avatars, bios, and social links.
* Friend request system with proper status handling and custom exceptions.
* Package visibility options: PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and ONLY\_FRIENDS.
* User metadata DTO for secure and optimized frontend communication.
* User settings functionality allowing profile and preference updates.

### üîí Security

* All API endpoints are secured with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* JWT-based authentication is fully integrated and tested.
* Package-level access control is implemented for different visibility levels.
* Modular `SecurityFilterChain` ensures tailored security policies per module.

### üßπ Code Cleanup & Performance

* Codebase optimized for maintainability and clarity.
* Swagger annotations reduced for cleaner API documentation.
* Unused dependencies removed for faster builds and runtime.

### üåê Frontend Integration (Planned)

* Initial backend API support is prepared for frontend consumption.
* A modern frontend client will be developed and integrated in future releases to enhance user experience and interface.

### ‚úÖ Known Issues

* No critical issues currently reported.
* Minor improvements will be addressed in upcoming patch releases based on user feedback.

### üìú License Change Notice

Starting from **version 2.0.0**, the project license has been changed from **Apache License** to **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)**.

* This change aims to promote **strong copyleft** principles, ensuring that all derivative works remain open source under the same license.
* Users and contributors must comply with the terms of GPL-3.0 from this version onwards.
* Previous versions remain under the Apache License.

---

## Version 2.0.1

* ‚úÖ **Fixed Swagger access issue:** Updated `CommonSecurityConfig` to allow proper access to Swagger UI.

---

## Version 2.0.2

* Readme updated

---

## Version 2.1.0-dev

* User setting repo implemented (still don't have controller)
* Auth API Java added
* Added Swagger doc to friend request action API

---

## Version 2.2.0-Beta

* The **UserContext** utility has been upgraded and can now retrieve user data.
* **AuthController** has been updated. JWT tokens are now stored directly in HTTP headers. I‚Äôm considering adding a refresh token mechanism in a future release (possibly version 4).
* The `packages/Securits` package has been renamed to `package/security`.
* The method `UserRegisterResponse userToUserRegisterResponse(User user)` has been removed.
* API versioning support has been added.

---

## Version 2.3.0 ‚Äì Stable

*  Return token directly to user instead of setting cookie (requested by frontend developer)


## Version 2.4.0-Beta

### Refactor
- Dependency handling in `PackageMetadataServiceImpl` has been improved:  
  The class now uses `FriendService` instead of the previous dependency, resulting in a cleaner and more testable implementation.
- The `getUsername()` method in `UserContext` has been removed:  
  User authentication and retrieval now rely exclusively on user IDs rather than usernames.
- `FriendRequestService` was refactored to fetch users by their unique IDs instead of usernames:  
  This change improves consistency, reduces potential for incorrect matches, and aligns with ID-based domain logic.
- The `author` field in the `PackageEntity` model has been changed from `String` to `Long`:  
  This allows direct association with user IDs and simplifies data integrity.
- Package naming was adjusted to improve clarity and maintain domain-driven design conventions:  
  The `dao` package has been renamed to `domain` for better readability and clearer responsibility separation.

### Notes
- This release removes username-based queries in favor of ID-based lookups.
- Because some fields were migrated to `Long` types, ensure your data migrations and integrations handle this change properly.
- Dependency simplification makes unit testing easier and allows broader use of mocking in service implementations.

### Version 2.5.0 -stable
### ‚ú® Features

* Added and implemented **PackageLike API**.
* Created and implemented **PackageLikeService**.
* Added **Like** model.
* Added **PackageLike** entity.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

### üõ† Refactoring

## üìå Changelog ‚Äî Version 2.7.0

### üîπ New Features

* **Error Management API**

  * Added `ErrorsApi` with endpoints to fetch:

    * All errors (`/errors/all`)
    * Server-side errors (`/errors/server`)
    * Client-side errors (`/errors/client`)
  * Implemented `ErrorsController` to provide REST access to error logs with pagination support.

* **Enhanced Exception Handling**

  * Introduced detailed stack trace capturing in `ErrorResponseUtil` (`Arrays.toString(e.getStackTrace())`).
  * Unified `ErrorResponse` DTO with Lombok annotations (`@Data`, `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`).

### üîπ Improvements

* Moved `ErrorResponseUtil` from `common.util` to `common.exception` package for better structure and consistency.
* Updated `ErrorRepository` method `findAllByErrorTypes` ‚Üí `findAllByErrorType` (fixing naming alignment).

* Simplified `GlobalExceptionHandler` imports and structure.

### üîπ Breaking Changes

* Removed hardcoded `@RequestMapping("/v1/auth")` from `AuthController`.

  * Endpoint mappings now rely on `AuthApi` configuration.
* Error DTO package moved from `error.domain.dto` to `error.dto`.

### üîπ Bug Fixes

* Fixed serialization issues for custom `ErrorResponse` by enforcing `application/json` response type.
* Ensured pagination metadata is returned properly when fetching error logs.
